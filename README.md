# Little Flockers
My favorite project from CS 440 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence!
Requires Java (maybe as little as Java 3?)
![A screenshot of the simulation in action](https://github.com/brandon8000/Little-Flockers/Flockers.jpg "Look at those flockers go!")

How To Use
----------
1. Fork this git repository or clone it as is
..- `git clone <repository URL>`
2. Go into the repository folder
..- `cd Little-Flockers`
3. Compile the java source code files into the 'bin' folder
..- `javac -d bin *.java`
4. Run any of the simulations located in the xml folder
..- `java -cp bin Simulation ./xml/<any xml file>`

How To Modify
-------------
The source file names should be a big hint but the functions to control the bird behaviors are located in Flocker.java starting at line 492
