Simulation Files
================

These XML files define virtual environments that get created by Simulation.java
Use the appropriate tags like `<flocker/>, <rock/> and <light/>` along with their proper attributes in order to fill the environment with agents, objects and goals respectively.
Follow the models presented by all of these files to get an idea of what attributes each tag has. Full documentation should be expressed by their related Java source code definitions.
